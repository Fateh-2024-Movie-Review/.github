# Fateh 2024 Movie Review

Sonu Sood has always been a name that audiences quietly root for, whether for his on-screen roles or his real-life humanitarian work. With *Fateh*, he steps behind the camera for the first time, bringing his passion for cinema to the director’s chair. The film’s slick trailer hinted at an engaging R-rated action entertainer, much in line with recent hits like *Animal*, *Kill*, and *Marco*. However, while the film boasts stylish action sequences and creative visual storytelling, it ultimately stumbles due to inconsistent writing and underdeveloped characters.

## A Promising Start with Creative Direction

One of the most striking elements of *Fateh* is Sonu Sood's directorial style, which exhibits a flair for snazzy transitions and cinematic experimentation. Moments like blood transitioning into ketchup, casual conversations about black coffee and biscuits leading into chaotic action, and the playful editing choices in dialogue exchanges show glimpses of an energetic filmmaker at work. Unfortunately, these creative flourishes fail to compensate for a script that lacks a solid foundation, making the overall impact of the film less effective than intended.
